## 🔧 Feature Implementation - TASK-003

### Description
Complete the core spam detection engine with all pattern matching algorithms as specified in the CRD.

### Current State Analysis
- Basic SpamDetector class structure exists
- Individual detector classes partially implemented
- Missing pattern combination logic
- Social engineering detection incomplete
- Investment scam detection needs refinement

### CRD Requirements (Section 2.1)
As per Customer Requirements Document, implement detection for:

#### 2.1.1 Investment Scam Patterns
- Keywords: 股海策略師, 投資, 股票, 理財, 獲利, 賺錢
- Pattern: Financial advisor promotion detection
- Target: 90%+ accuracy rate

#### 2.1.2 Cryptocurrency Scam Patterns  
- Keywords: 比特幣, 以太幣, 加密貨幣, 虛擬貨幣, 快速致富
- Pattern: Crypto investment promotion

#### 2.1.3 Generic Spam Patterns
- Repetitive promotional content
- Excessive emoji usage
- Suspicious link patterns

#### 2.1.4 Social Engineering Patterns
- User tagging to spread scams
- Multiple user targeting
- Promotional content distribution

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Investment scam detection working (90%+ accuracy)
- [ ] Cryptocurrency scam detection implemented
- [ ] Generic spam detection patterns complete
- [ ] Social engineering detection functional  
- [ ] Pattern combination logic working correctly
- [ ] Confidence scoring system implemented
- [ ] Multi-language support (Chinese, English)
- [ ] All unit tests pass for detection methods
- [ ] Performance: processing < 100ms per comment

### Implementation Tasks

#### Phase 1: Core Detection Logic
- [ ] Fix `investmentScamDetector.js` pattern matching
- [ ] Complete `cryptoScamDetector.js` implementation
- [ ] Enhance `genericSpamDetector.js` patterns
- [ ] Implement `socialEngineeringDetector.js` logic

#### Phase 2: Integration & Optimization
- [ ] Implement `SpamDetector.combineResults()` method
- [ ] Add confidence scoring algorithm
- [ ] Optimize pattern matching performance
- [ ] Add pattern learning from false positives

#### Phase 3: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Create comprehensive test cases
- [ ] Validate against real-world examples
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Accuracy measurement

### Files to Modify
- `src/detectors/spamDetector.js` - Main orchestrator
- `src/detectors/investmentScamDetector.js` - Investment patterns
- `src/detectors/cryptoScamDetector.js` - Crypto patterns  
- `src/detectors/genericSpamDetector.js` - Generic patterns
- `src/detectors/socialEngineeringDetector.js` - User tagging patterns
- `tests/unit/spamDetector.test.js` - Update tests

### Technical Specifications
- **Input**: Comment object with text, author, metadata
- **Output**: Detection result with isSpam, confidence, patterns, type
- **Performance**: < 100ms processing time
- **Memory**: Efficient pattern storage and matching
- **Accuracy**: Balance precision vs recall for 90%+ investment scam detection

### Success Metrics
- Unit tests: All detection tests pass
- Performance: Comment analysis < 100ms
- Accuracy: 90%+ true positive rate for investment scams
- False positives: < 2% for legitimate content
- Coverage: All spam pattern types detected

### Estimated Time
3-4 days

### Phase
Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

### Dependencies
- Requires TASK-001 (Build System Fix) completed
- Requires TASK-002 (Test Infrastructure) completed

### Related Issues
- Enables TASK-005 (Content Script Core Features)
- Supports TASK-006 (Advanced Detection Algorithms)
- Required for MVP completion criteria
